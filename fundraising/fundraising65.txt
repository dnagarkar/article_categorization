Fundraising Explained: Implementing Your Early-Stage Financing Needs
Understanding the general lingo surrounding startup fundraising is of fundamental importance to the entrepreneur both when considering a raise and speaking with business contacts. I’ve been voraciously reading and collecting a diverse spectrum of recent articles regarding topical fundraising matters, and honestly, the more I read, the more perplexed I am by the glaring lack of structure or consensus. The impressive trajectory of private-enterprise investment is both exciting and indicative of technological advancement, yet it is also mired in exaggeration and farcical linguistics. Just to name a few examples: the divisive rifts surrounding the lack AND surplus of tech unicorns, hyperbolic opinions on effervescent private valuations leading to hypothetical Black Swan events and the general inanity surrounding accurate fundraising round definitions — or lack thereof. The issue for many is that this venture/angel financing lingo is not only complex, but also constantly in flux as capital ebbs and flows with industry and economic cycles.
My hope in producing the following series on fundraising is to provide a broad outline of terms and definitions that, in aggregate, should help you avoid the proverbial “elephant in the room” situation. This potential conversationalist pitfall often arises when an entrepreneur fails to understand basic investor rhetoric, digging an insurmountable hole for himself/herself, or rather, a hapless knowledge vacuum. Of course, falling victim to this paralyzing discourse is ubiquitous in the land of the habitual networker, as by principle, there is a theoretical limit to personal knowledge. We of the nouveaux nightly-event culture are bound to get into that nightmarish conversation where the only plausible responses are: evasive circumlocution, a feigned “yes!” a stammering “mhm,” or a vapid affirmative gesticulation of the hands or head. Why trigger the awkward elephant lumbering around the room or the vociferous monkey clinging to your back when you could simply respond or even lead a conversation detailing the subtleties of your fundraising round?
Just to reiterate, many of these terms are malleable — based on industry and location- specific considerations — and can be adjusted without notice as the marketplace evolves (Silicon Valley will often have different $ value parameters for particular rounds as compared to Boston or New York, for instance). As an aside, NextView Ventures has a fantastic blog called “
View From the Seed
” which contains a plethora of useful investment terminology of which I cite via links at multiple points in this series.
Well, let’s take a stab at it, shall we?
Friends, Family and Fools:
The FF or FFF round, (the acronym’s origin stemming from the hindsight revelation that a failed startup played you as the fool) is a startup’s original source of capital, excluding those monies flowing out of founders’ pockets or a bank loan. Typically, in order to keep a company’s capital structure as basic as possible from the outset, founders will issue common stock in this round, though a convertible note or even plain vanilla debt are common as well. While dollar amounts vary based on one’s personal connections, the Friends & Family round is generally used to raise $25K-150K with some unusual rounds upwards of 500K. This first informal round is very useful as a means of turning a concept into a tangible business model though its implementation can be tricky from a legal perspective. Tips

Grainy but useful tidbit: Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933 details certain exemptions pertaining to registration of private placement security offerings (Friends & Family rounds can be exempted from SEC registration); one of these exemptions allows companies to bypass the traditional rule that securities can only be offered to accredited investors. Despite this very useful exemption, startups should be conscientious of the fact that accepting a check from a close personal contact is a dangerous proposition due to the extreme risk of the investment class. Full disclosure of risk factors, including loss of principal and a “no information” clauses, is critical as no founder wants to deal with the double-whammy burden of lost relationships AND lawsuits if the investment sours.

Though an FF round will presumably include non-accredited investors who believe in your vision, many founders have emphasized that accredited investors should be included in this round whenever possible for their experience and relative financial security. The reasoning here is that the potential loss of a 10K check will be partially mitigated by the fact that these investors will not have to sell the farm to make ends meet. Sweetening your term sheet in regards to a favorable equity stake, interest rate on a loan or discount on a convertible note is a logical way of making this first capital raise more attractive to close contacts who might otherwise be wary of investing in an “idea.” Remember, friends and family are investing in YOU first and your idea second, as there are no tangible metrics to gauge the viability of your product at this point. In summary, heed the warning that friends and family members must be fully aware of the risk/reward relationship inherent in an extremely early-stage investment opportunity and craft your term sheet in an equitable, transparent manner.
The Pre-Seed Round:
The differences between the FF round and the Pre-Seed — or what is sometimes called an “Angel” or “Genesis round” — are murky, to say the least. What generally sets these very early rounds apart is that the Pre-Seed round, if and when raised, will typically include individual angel investors for the first time and will most likely be used to transition from idea stage to pre-product or prototype stage. A general rule of thumb is that if a startup raises a Pre-Seed, it should not be much more than $500K, or more importantly, it should not interfere with raising a traditional Seed round down the road in terms of $ value, proposed use of funds or strategic roadmap.
