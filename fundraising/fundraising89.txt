My Fundraising Anthem for Series A
Real quick, I have to get this out of my system…
You will hear it in the street or you can read it in the press
Do you really wanna know what’s next? Let’s go
See the way we on it and we all up in the race and you know
We gotta go, now try to keep up with the pace
And we struggle and I hustle and I set it and I get it
And we always gotta do it take it to another place
Gotta taste it and I gotta grab it
And I gotta cut all through this traffic
Just to be at the top of the throne
Better know I gotta have it, have it
Look at me now, look at me now
Oh, I’m getting paper
Look at me now
Oh, look at me now
Yeah, fresher than a motherfuckerThank you Andy, best track.
