Quick Fundraising Tips
Excellent public speaking is a requirement. Bad pitch = no $$$.
Set Low Round Targets. Makes the round appear more competitive and you can always increase it with success.
Ask existing and small investors to ‘reserve’ space while they decide. Makes the round appear to fill up quickly.
If an investor interrupts your pitch to ask a question, answer it. Outstanding questions will be real mind blockers. Iterate and fix your pitch to address common questions.
Push maybes to noes. Accept that you will get a lot of noes when fundraising, be willing to push people who are deciding to a no. Rarely does a long decision result in a yes.
The best source of new investor leads is the investor who just wrote you a check. Comb the networks of each new investor, after they’ve wired the money.
