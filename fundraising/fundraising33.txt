Are you planning to fundraise for growth from private investors? A #founder MUST think like an investor. Here are 5 things IÂ learned:
#Risks: Investors dislike risks. You must identify & explain how your startup mitigates them.
2. #Information: Investors suffer from information deficit. They have limited info to make decisions.
3. #Opportunity: Investors jungle with opportunities cost. Youâ€™re competing with other deals.
4. Current #market conditions: the overall market outlook also plays a part.
5. #Investment rules: 1st rule is not to loose money. 2nd rule is to remember the 1st rule. Your startup must pass this test. ðŸ˜Ž
Whatâ€™s your #startup fundraising experience?
