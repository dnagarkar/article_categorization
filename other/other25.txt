The Creativity ofÂ Cameras.
I lead a photography Experience, through Airbnb, every week.
 On these little three-hour tours, I take 5 people around Los Angeles, to some very cool locations, and go over technique and composition with them as the sun goes down. It can get pretty technical after dark as we get into long exposure shots, but what people seem to take away from it is much more than settings, which they can learn in about 30 minutes.
