Whatâ€™s an â€˜investment horizonâ€™?
We caught up with Kiwibank Chief Economistâ€Šâ€”
â€ŠZoe Wallis
 who shared what an investment horizon is, and why itâ€™s important to know yours. Hereâ€™s Zoeâ€¦
Does it matter if Iâ€™m investing for a year or tenÂ years?
Absolutely!
There are a few important things to think about when investing. A key one is the length of time you can leave your money invested for. Generally, this has a big impact on the type of things you invest in.
One example that often catches people in NZ out, is ending up in default â€˜conservativeâ€™ funds when they sign up for Kiwisaver.
Choosing a conservative fund might be a good outcome if youâ€™re 60 and looking to use that money soon. But if youâ€™re 25 and not looking to use that money for 40 years then youâ€™re much better off in the long-run being in a â€˜growthâ€™ fund.
The same theory applies to your Sharesies investments.
What do these labelsÂ mean?
You can see in 
Sharesies
, all investments come with a â€˜conservativeâ€™, â€˜balancedâ€™ or â€˜growthâ€™ labelâ€Šâ€”â€Šthis indicates the type of portfolio an investment might suit.
Investments that are labelled conservative, tend to suit relatively low risk portfolios and donâ€™t experience as big gains or losses over time as those funds labelled growth. This means that youâ€™re unlikely to lose much money in a conservative fund over time, but also that your gains may not be as large.
If you can handle the greater ups and downs (also known as volatility) from growth assets, then over time they tend to outperform other asset types. But if you know youâ€™ll need the money in the next couple of years, then a conservative investment is probably a better option.
Generally, the longer you can leave the investment before you want to touch the money, the more risk you can take.
How do I work out my investment horizon?
Here are a few rules of thumb that might help with your investment choices:
Short-termâ€Šâ€”â€Š
likely to use the money within the next 2â€“3 years. Look at â€˜conservativeâ€™ options like bonds, term deposits or savings accounts. If youâ€™re prepared to take some risk then you could invest up to 20% of your money in a â€˜balancedâ€™ fund.
Medium-termâ€Šâ€”â€Š
likely to take your money out in the next 3â€“10 years. Look at a mix of â€˜balancedâ€™ and â€˜growthâ€™ funds. But itâ€™s also still a good idea to keep some (say 20â€“40%) of your money in bonds or similar assets.
Long-termâ€Šâ€”â€Š
likely to leave your money invested for over 10 years. Look mostly at riskier assets such as â€˜growthâ€™ stocks, although good to keep a small amount (say 10â€“20%) in â€˜conservativeâ€™ assets in case you end up needing to take some money out earlier.
A side note:
 Before you invest, make sure you keep about 3â€“6 months of rainy day money set aside in an easy-to-access savings account.
One of the other major factors to help decide what you should invest in, is how comfortable you are with taking risk. If you havenâ€™t already, check out the investor
