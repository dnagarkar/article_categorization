Hiring for hyper-scale: pipelining veterans into¬†tech
We just wrapped up our fourth VetTechTrek and wanted to recognize our 
growing list of hosts
 who took time out of their day to make New York our most successful trip ever. After being 3x oversubscribed on participants and 2x oversubscribed on hosts, we‚Äôre at a tipping point and have validated the model that pipelines military veterans to tech companies.
Snapshot of VetTechTrek Host¬†Partners
Every few months, VetTechTrek brings a group of recent military veterans inside of 10+ tech companies, skills academies, and startup accelerators. We‚Äôve previously visited 
San Francisco
 (
twice
) and 
Washington DC
 and we think a lot about the 
value proposition that veterans bring
 to early and growth stage technology companies.
Our goal is to build a known path between the military and tech, and we‚Äôre doing this by breaking the mold of traditional recruiting practices. We don‚Äôt charge referral or commission fees, which aligns our incentives with the desires of our participants: to get the best job in the shortest amount of time possible.
Our efforts were 
recently featured in TechCrunch
 (update: 
TechCrunch announcement
 of Y Combinator partnership), and we‚Äôre planning some exciting things just over the horizon that will promote veteran founders, veteran women, and to narrow the skills gap that exists for certain roles.
We‚Äôre doing our very first VetTechTrek LIVE on Thursday, December 10th. We‚Äôre visiting 13 companies in 3 cities in 3 hours.

VTT NYC‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäDay¬†1
We kicked off Day 1 at the 9/11 Memorial. In light of Veteran‚Äôs Day, this was a great way to bring everyone together for the first time and pay our respects to the heroes of New York and honor the men and women still serving on Active Duty.
The first company we visited was 
Dataminr
, where we were welcomed by veterans 
Pat Ryan
 and Chris Ryan. Dataminr struck a chord with many in the group, because of its mission to provide realtime alerts and crisis notifications to clients.
The group then learned about programs that 
General Assembly
 offers, to include both part-time and full-time immersives in coding, design, and product management. Most notably, we learned about the 
GA Opportunity Fund
 which provides funding for veterans and other underrepresented groups.
At this point, a portion of the trek broke off for a visit to 
Foursquare
 HQ to say thank you to CEO 
Dennis Crowley
 and HR VP 
Meghan Lapides
 for sponsoring one of our trek participants!
The group reunited at the 
WeWork
 headquarters in Chelsea where we had the chance to visit with about a dozen early stage companies taking residence in the co-working space. This experience provided a valuable contrast to the later stage companies on the trek and allowed us to get a feel for what tech companies look like at conception and formation. WeWork co-founder and Israeli Defense Force veteran Ariel Tiger joined us for a private discussion about translating military skills into operating a company at hyper-scale.
After WeWork, we joined veteran 
Ben Williams
 at 
Reelio
. It was particularly great meeting with Ben who has co-founded seven companies and is one of the finest examples for other veterans thinking about starting their own companies. While we often have the chance to meet with a company‚Äôs senior directors, a critical focus of VetTechTrek is to witness veterans operating successfully at all levels within the tech industry, especially founders.
We finished up Day 1 at 
Plated
 with veteran 
Katie Horgan
. Katie provided direct, operational advice for transitioning service members. Not only that, she also organized a Q&A discussion with representatives from every single department at Plated, which allowed the group to answer questions ranging from finance and analytics to product management and user experience.
VTT NYC‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäDay¬†2
Twitter NYC Leadership devoting their morning to hiring¬†veterans
Day 2 kicked off with breakfast at Twitter and a panel discussion arranged by 
Linds Panther
 with VP 
matt derella
. In their brand new offices, we had the chance to interface with leadership from the sales and HR departments and break off for extended one-on-one discussions at the end of the visit. Twitter gained a few new users as a result of the discussion üòè
Participants 
wired in
 at Google¬†NYC
After visiting Twitter, we joined Google for a luncheon with veterans Nick Lozano and Lance Dunbar, and Diversity Program Lead Exie Huntington. They emphasized the incredible value within the 
Google Veterans network
. It‚Äôs hard to overstate how encouraging it is to find advocates within an organization who are willing to talk through the intimidating hiring process.
The group then walked over to Uber‚Äôs offices in Chelsea. Veteran John Proietti (Uber‚Äôs Head of East Coast Community) met with us and talked through different avenues veterans can take to positively brand themselves after military service.
The second to last stop was Venmo, where we met with Head of People Sue Choe and members of the product, data, and engineering teams for a comprehensive panel discussion on the popular peer-to-peer payments company. With several former military HR professionals in attendance, it was an honor to meet with Sue who has built one of the best company cultures in all of tech at Venmo.
We‚Äôre doing our very first VetTechTrek LIVE on Thursday, December 10th. We‚Äôre visiting 13 companies in 3 cities in 3 hours.

Warby Parker CTO 
Lon B.
 welcomed us to their offices and gave the most hard-hitting Networking 101 rundown VetTechTrek has ever experienced. Over the course of two days, themes of translating military service started to arise and Lon‚Äôs breakdown unexpectedly tied the entire experience together into a cohesive message as the company visits came to a close.
Of course, no VetTechTrek would be complete without a 
Wetdown
 (or 
social mixer
), where we welcomed 100 other veterans and members of the New York startup community to 
Rise New York
. We were also hosted by 
Alex Tarhini
 of 
Techstars
 for a discussion on how to attract more veterans into startup accelerators.
