The value of a Performance ReviewIâ€™m interested how much emphasis should we place on it in this day in age?
In a society where social media allows us to access the information we want instantly, how relevant is it to sum up ones performance in an annual?
Business success seems to be going into the direction of quick, in the moment feedback to adjust to the current market- that said, when giving an annual review, what information is relevant to provide a successful annual that the individual will retain?
