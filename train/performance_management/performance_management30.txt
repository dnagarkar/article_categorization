Who’s In Your Corner?
So as the saying goes…
It’s not what you know, but who you know!
Relationships, connections, and networks are critical for all of us to work together and get things done.
And sure, it’s good to have some reliable people in your corner who know you and can speak good about who you are, what you represent, and what you’re doing.
However, let’s face it, there are 
some
 people out there that take advantage and don’t just have advocates, but rather protectors, and it’s a way for those who may be unqualified, unsavory, and incompetent — as individual — to sustain themselves.
Frankly, some of these people should never be in their jobs and should never be a leader over anything or anybody — but they are enabled, because of who and not what they know or are able to do.
Whether it’s the Peter Principle or bullies and those without a working moral compass or sometimes it seems even a conscience, it can be very scary at times for what suffices as leadership in many organizations.
Yes, of course, Thank G-d for the 
many
 good, well-meaning, and hardworking folks that make getting up in the morning as well as going into the office, worthwhile.
But for those that hide behind the skirts of others, so that they can get away with things that they should never ever be getting away with…well those are not fruitful relationships being maintained, but rather caustic ones that radiate concentric circles of toxicity to organizations, people, and mission.
People know it when they see it — because it stinks from the stench of bad apples, bullying, disengagement, lack of accountability and ultimately failure.
We desperately need 
each
 person to perform and to band together as an A-Team.
However, sink or swim — as individuals, each person in their own based on their conscience and contribution without a phony mask of a protectorate accomplice. ;-)
