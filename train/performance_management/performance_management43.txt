Couldn’t agree more . Following are enough reasons to start thinking about abolishing the Annual Performance Reviews:
•	Employees need and want regular performance feedback (daily, weekly), so a once-a-year review is not only too late but is often a surprise. Regular coaching is the key to alignment and performance. 
•	Managers cannot typically “judge” an entire year of work from an individual at one time, so the annual review is awkward and uncomfortable for both manager and employee. 
•	Manager-employee relationships are not 1:1 like they used to be. We work with many leaders and peers during the year, so one person cannot adequately rate you without lots of peer input. 
•	While some employees are a poor fit and likely are poor performers, these issues should be addressed immediately with performance coaching, not at the end of the year. 
•	Some companies really do have a lot of high performers, so forced ranking eliminates great people and damages the culture of a results-based high-performance organization. 
•	People are inspired and motivated by ongoing positive, constructive feedback – and the “appraisal” process almost always works against this. 
•	The most valuable part of an appraisal is the “development planning” conversation – what can one do to improve performance and engagement – and this is often left to a small box on the review form.
