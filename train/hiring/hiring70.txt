What hiring a freelancer on Upwork, Toptal (and other sites) says about yourÂ company
For the past 3 years Iâ€™ve probably looked at more freelance job boards than anyone on earth. Iâ€™ve found over 6,000 high-quality gigs (and in the process thrown out more than 20X that many). Iâ€™ve noticed patterns emerge, not just about 
the places
 I find these opportunities, but also about the companies who use these places to find help. Where you hire not only determines who sees your job or project, it shapes the type of person youâ€™re looking for. Hereâ€™s 1 word to describe how these places shape who youâ€™re hiring (and how they rub off on you):Unprofessional
Upwork
The place people go in search of a deal. Deals that are a mirage. They donâ€™t exist on Upwork. Youâ€™re just too busy scrambling to re-coup high fees levied on you (up to 20% per project for freelancers and 2.75% per transaction for clients) to notice. Upwork tries to make up for this with volume but just attracts more spam and shady applicants than actual talent. Not only does this severely decrease the chances youâ€™ll find someone great, it means you lose a ton of your own valuable time in the process. This leads to unprofessional work and unprofitable (the other word I wanted to use for Upwork) projects for your company.
ðŸ”® My crystal ball tells me: youâ€™re not seeing results because you prioritize finding a deal over investing in excellence.Confined
Craigslist
Craigslist isnâ€™t the worst. But itâ€™s surely not great. Using Craiglist severely limits your reach. Itâ€™s unreasonable to expect the right freelancers for your project (from all over the world) to keep tabs on your specific
 COUNTYâ€™S 
Craigslist section everyday. Especially for remote projects, it doesnâ€™t make sense to post on Craigslist because you handcuff yourself.
ðŸ”® My crystal ball tells me: youâ€™re defaulting to the easiest option in other areas of your business too and itâ€™s limiting your potential.Talentless
Toptal
Hereâ€™s a dirty secret: Toptal doesnâ€™t screen its talent-pool for skills that will 
necessarily
 help you. Instead they put developers through computer-sciency tests that look good on paper but may or may not have be in anyway related to your projectâ€™s success. Their claim of only offering the 
â€˜top 3% of developersâ€™
 is arbitrary at best. If youâ€™re attracted to it, itâ€™s actually an indicator youâ€™re lacking knowledge thatâ€™s necessary in making a great hiring decision in a complicated field.
ðŸ”® My crystal ball tells me: even if you find someone great youâ€™ll struggle to manage them because you lack confidence in this area.Exctinct
Elance
You havenâ€™t hired someone in a while right?
ðŸ”® My crystal ball tells me: ðŸ’€Peaked
Poacher
If youâ€™ve hired top-talent from another well-known company simply because they worked for another well-known company, it probably means youâ€™ve paid a premium to get them. In an already inflated market, that means you over-paid. The talent youâ€™ve acquired has probably done their best work and now youâ€™re left with someone past their prime.
ðŸ”® My crystal ball tells me: youâ€™re believing too much of the hype surrounding your industry and are vulnerable to upcoming changes.Static
Stackoverflow
Most opportunities on Stackoverflow look the same. Every post is formulaic in look and feel. Thereâ€™s zero personality around your company when you post there. That means you donâ€™t stand out and your listing ends up feeling more like noise than anything else. Not a great way to start your relationship with a developer.
ðŸ”® My crystal ball tells me: youâ€™re drowning in vanity metrics because you emphasize bullet-list style requirements throughout your business.Locked-in
Linkedin
Similar to Craiglist youâ€™re confined. Linkedin job posts arenâ€™t just hard to find, theyâ€™re completely nonexistent unless you use the platform. Next time, try logging out of your account and looking for your job post. You wonâ€™t find it. Why? Because Linkedinâ€™s interested in keeping people on Linkedin. That means they keep a very closed platform, and a lot of times you get stuck with the bill. Youâ€™re not the priority, youâ€™re the product.
ðŸ”® My crystal ball tells me: youâ€™re not investing enough in your own audience so youâ€™re at the mercy of too many other platforms.These are just a few of the options at your disposal.

I believe itâ€™s better than any of the options listed above.
