Introduction
It would be fair to say that typography is the hardest part of the UI Design. It is with us for a very long time in various forms. Thanks to that we have a lot of rules, practices and theories for whom hard to keep up. In this article I will give you few practical tips and tricks that you can use in your projects.
Practical examples over theory
Although typography is a fascinating topic to talk about I will not bother you with theoretical part. Rather than talking about letter anatomy and ligatures we will dive straight into practice.
Buuut if you want …
Think about the users
We should remember that besides aesthetics we have users. You are designing not only for high resolution flagship devices but for a little bit more…
Font you will use need to be flexible. Your font should offer variety of weights, wide range of special symbols and it need to render very well not only on retina. It’s important to pay attention to this aspects so your users will not suffer from your ignorance. Good typography is “transparent” to the reader but the bad one will scream from display.
Understanding what make letters readable gives us a better overall view on what we should look for when choosing a font for our UI.
Legibility
Legibility is a measure of how easy it is to distinguish one letter from another in a particular typeface. It’s micro-typography that focus on the typeface, letters and details. Naturally, this is one of the most essential factor. Not all typefaces are created with legibility as a primary design function. The most common problem is lack of distinction between capital I and lowercase l. You need to avoid this kind of fonts because people will have problems reading them on small displays.
X-height
95% of the letters we read are lowercases. Larger letter proportions between uppercase and lowercase tend to result in a more legible typeface.
Counters
We also have white space within the letters. For example look at “o” “u” “d”. Those spaces are called counters and typographic professionals believes that more of it help us to easier recognize the letters.
Weight
Lighter typefaces are usually more legible than heavier weights of type. It’s related to counters and allow for non modified character shapes.
Which one is easier to read ?
The best character stroke thickness is about 18% of the x-height.
Wide proportion
Width of a character in relation to its height is described as proportion. Generally you want wide letter over condensed one for better letter recognition and thanks to that for better legibility.
At first difference is subtle
Letter spacing
There is no ultimate way to calculate letter spacing but most of the time the bigger text size you have the less letter spacing you will need. Typeface will appear too open and you need to manually adjust spacing. For UI design it applies usually to headers.
Again, it’s small difference.
Readability
Readability is about overall reading experience. How easy can we scan text layout, distinguish heading, subheading, paragraphs and blocks. It’s macro-typography that’s about making text more visually appealing in order to make it more encouraging to read. It’s really an art of contrast, color, size, composition and small details that results in better reading experience.
Serif vs Sans Serif
History tells us that serifs are more legible. They were used in print for a long time and they really improve reading experience for large blocks of text. Serif allows eye to flow more easily over the text.
The story is different on the web and mobile. There are several sans-serifs that are readable and current state of visual design prefer simpler letterforms. On the web and especially on mobile we see much more sans-serifs. Furthermore display is not paper and usually we are not reading long texts on the web. Especially in apps.
Not a single serif in twitter app but in Medium it makes sense
It all depends on your project and how users will consume your content. For example on medium we have serif because most of the time you will read something longer. That’s a good design approach.
Line height
When it comes to leading I’m highly suggest to use golden ratio.
Multiply your letter size by 1.618 and you will get perfect line height.

If you are more experienced then you can manually adjust this outcome. Of course there are exceptions of this rule and you can always break it if it’s necessarily.
Minor difference but it affect our readability heavily
Text block width
It’s like treading on thin ice. Too wide text blocks will cause our eyes to have hard time finding next line of text. If the lines are too narrow the eye will need to jump from line to line to often breaking the reading rhythm.
Our subconscious mind is energized when jumping to the next line (as long as it not so frequent).
To energize your readers and keep them engaged, your text line should have between 50 to 75 characters.
Colors
This of course depends on the project but there is one trick that I would like to share. Instead of using pure gray colors (or black) pick your main color and work somewhere here:
Look at pink triangle.
It will be more attractive and unique than using common #CCC. Small detail that will make your visuals better.
White space
That’s a vast topic with many books and great publications but when it comes to typography you need to remember this one:
The basic role of white space is to reduce the amount of text visitors see all at once.
This makes our layout more scannable and it doesn’t overload us with content. White space guides our eyes through the layout and create feeling of order, sophistication and elegance.

Hierarchy
Hierarchy defines how to read through content. It tells us how to distinguish header from subheading and body text. We can achieve this by using different contrast, text sizes, paddings, margins and so on. It’s an important technique that need to be mastered in order to achieve good readability.
Pay attention to details. Date text color is different than description but the difference is hard to see at first.

Separators
Good way for dividing content into sections is to use separator. The most popular is simple line. It’s subtle tool but still play a big role in readability.
Another way is to use popular right now cards. They are really good when content within is not related. Great for mobile and big thumbs but also improve our layout scannability.
Both examples at once.

Repetition and rhythm
This is the most time consuming part of UI design (at least for me). Any element that is repeated provides unity. The repetition may be positioning, text size, colors, padding, margins, use of rules, background and boxes. For example I’m usually rounding size of the padding/margin to 5 so it looks even more consistent (that’s one of my rules). Repetition produces rhythm.

Conclusion
Learning typography is a fascinating journey with it’s entire hipstery, fancy words and satisfying view at your skill progression. Skills doesn’t come from reading articles on medium but from learning and practicing. So open your Sketch (sorry PS dinosaurs) and create something awesome.
