Great article. :-)
One of the wisest pieces of advice I’ve received during my career is “HR is your friend until things go wrong” meaning they are there to support all employees but when push comes to shove their first interest is to protect the company against law suits hard-done-by employees could wage and win. For some HR people, yes, that and self-preservation is their only interest. In my experience, that’s more about the person than the role. Mostly because I’ve also known HR people across the entire gambit ranging from those that’ll quit rather than tow an unethical corporate line to those who inspire a calling of ex-employees to bad mouth the company after they leave.
What key HR-related mistake I suspect most people make though is forgetting that HR people are in fact just that; people. A lot of people never speak with anyone from HR at the coffee machine or anywhere else. They see HR at hiring, exiting, and very briefly at any major life events along the way … and they never build any rapport. So when some employee is facing some challenge they are seen as just another cog in the corporate wheel. And they unwittingly become masters of their own undoing.
There are people out in the world with lots of empathy for strangers but those kinds of people are rare. People who expect HRers to be more empathetic or non-manipulative than they are themselves would be well advised to gain a reality check; and fast. There was a song a while back … something about starting with the man (or woman for that matter) in the mirror. And BTW, and if anyone is suspecting … no, I’m not HR. :-)
