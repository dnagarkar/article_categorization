Answer These Important Questions Before Fundraising
Here are 50 guiding questions that prompt founders to think critically and creatively before taking their first fundraising call

At Rough Draft Ventures we work with hundreds of first-time founders at the earliest stage. We’re often their first supporters, backing them with raw products and an inspiring vision. Our goal is to accelerate them to the next stage — one where they have the traction and infrastructure that deserves additional funding.
Over the past four years, we’ve backed nearly 100 student-founded startups that have raised additional funding from leading seed stage firms including Founder Collective, Box Group, First Round Capital, Slow Ventures, and Lerer Hippeau Ventures.
As first-time-raisers, our founders often turn to us for advice on how to navigate the complicated world of fundraising. Throughout these conversations, we’ve identified a set of questions that encourage our founders to think critically about why they’re fundraising, help them articulate a strong narrative, position their current story within the broader narrative of the company, and illuminate areas of improvement.
Before taking your first fundraising meeting, be sure you have an original and thoughtful answer to these 50 questions.
