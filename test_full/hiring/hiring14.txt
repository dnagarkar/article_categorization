The Egghead Entrepreneur on Building a Great Team
Presented by Pete & Gerry’s

Pete & Gerry’s CEO Jesse Laflamme is the thinker and tinker behind a thriving network of family farms that produces organic eggs from hens raised humanely. His is the fastest-growing organic egg brand in America and the first in the world to achieve Certified B Corporation status. By following his instincts, conscience, and love of data, Jesse’s leading the reinvention of an industry he loves. Not bad for a guy who says he started out getting it wrong.
In a series of six posts from October through December 2016, Jesse shares some of what he knows and wants to get to know. In this final post, he shares some tenets of his radically team-oriented management style.
My management style is very team-oriented. I came directly from college to this job, so my frame of reference is my experience on athletic teams. I put a lot of trust in the people around me and treat them as equals. Everybody is expected to contribute to get the job done. That said, here are a few “rules” that seem to be working for me:
Rule 1: Lead by example.
Leadership status is earned by working harder than everybody else. You need to be prepared to roll up your sleeves and do any job necessary in any moment. When a leader jumps in to do a task that’s not his responsibility because someone else is swamped, that goes a long way toward cementing the team. You have to lead from within rather than from above.
Rule 2: Breed humility, not heroism.
Singling people out as heroes on any given day isn’t good in the long run; it foments rivalries within the team. You want a healthy competition, not a rivalry. You want people who want to do better, not better than somebody else.
Rule 3: Reward a job well done — but not too much or too publicly.
An extension of Rule 2: For one thing, when people really believe in what they’re doing, a job well done is its own reward. That said…sure, everybody needs and deserves a pat on the back or even a more tangible reward of some kind sometimes. But you can praise or reward people privately rather than in a public, disruptive way. You needn’t throw them a parade.
Rule 4: Trust people to do their jobs and stay out of their way.
Rather than look at someone and think the knee-jerk “That’s not the way I’d do it,” maybe ask yourself “Is that better than what I would do? Does this person have insight I don’t have?” Once you’ve established they know what they’re doing, leave our team members alone to do their job.
Rule 5: Nobody likes a person on a power trip.
Some people love to be the boss; they’re driven by the very idea of it. I’m an introvert, so that doesn’t do much for me. It’s more that I’m compelled to be in charge because I have the history and experience.
I think the fact that I’m a reluctant leader works to my advantage. I honestly don’t want people to just listen up when I speak; I want to be in the middle of the conversation, part of it. The fact that the team knows that makes our conversations more fruitful.
Rule 6: Learn to hire well.
Given our location, it can be hard for us to find the talent we want. We do it through networking, primarily. We’re getting better at it, and I think I can identify a few sub-rules that are working pretty well for us.
a) Consider cultural fit first, skills second. For us, that fit starts with humility. Is this person genuinely looking to put the group ahead of themselves? It takes maturity at any age to step back and think, “I know I was the one who led on this, but I don’t need to be celebrated for that. The team won.” People who need to self-promote in my mind have a lot of insecurity.
b) Watch candidates’ “tells.” Everybody claims to be a team player. We’re trying to get better at judging how accurate that claim is. One real “tell” is this: When they’re talking about past accomplishments, is it a lot of I’s — I did this and I did that? For us, “we’s” are better — We did this. We did that.
c) Love the work. And bring on people who can love it, too.
I grew up with chickens. A hen named Nellie was my near-constant companion when I was little. I’d carry her under my arm like a football. She traveled in my bike basket, sat next to me in the sandbox. I have an appreciation for chicken personalities and think anyone who works with us should, too.
