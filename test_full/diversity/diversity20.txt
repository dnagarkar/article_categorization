Why Tech Needs an Agile and Iterative Approach to D&I
Diversity & Inclusion Leader Spotlight: Ellie Tumbuan, Chief Strategy Officer at The Justice Collective

By Jared Karol
In today’s Diversity & Inclusion Leader Spotlight, we hear from Ellie Tumbuan, Chief Strategy Officer at The Justice Collective, whose mission is to support changemaking and changemakers to be more effective, impactful and connected to the communities they serve, to policymakers and funders and to each other.
Change Catalyst: What are you currently working on to improve diversity and inclusion in tech?
Ellie: My company partners with clients to build customized, comprehensive D&I strategy based on their unique needs and circumstances. We develop plans and implementation that will sustain meaningful results for them. Yes, there are a number of well known best practices — transparency around hiring data, implicit bias training, cultivating the right strategic community partnerships — but we often find that until you help companies build the internal cultural and process capacity to carry out that work, the best prescriptive planning can result in a lack of confidence to execute, or just plain “analysis paralysis.” We’ve found the greatest success in taking an agile, iterative approach with companies to ensure they build the skills and staff needed to carry D&I missions through and, as we like to say, go beyond what’s possible and actually do what’s necessary.
That includes a range of different things: teaching on how to change the neuroplasticity of the brain by building emotional intelligence and recognizing when we’re most vulnerable to our biases; performing culture audits and business process analyses; analyzing the employee life cycle and pinpointing where a company can build better processes and solutions to retain talent and make culture more inclusive; helping companies develop and actually implement and interpret the right metrics, and understand where they fall amongst their peers. In addition, we coach and advise executive leadership, assess organizational strength for certain types of changes and pivots, and develop curriculum on various topics — from structural racism to gender oppression, transphobia, homophobia, and creating a culture of belonging for nonbinary identities.
We’re also launching a peer-learning leadership development cohort for mid-level professionals of color based around the idea of abundance. The plan is to cultivate the skill-sharing of expert knowledge already in our networks, and create safe spaces for folks to be in community together.
Change Catalyst: What motivates you to work towards an inclusive tech ecosystem?
Ellie: My own experience of knowing what I had to offer and being faced with the lack of roles, spaces, and platforms within which to excel and really bring my full talent — the lack of thinking, the mindset, to recognize my value. The opportunity to innovate and use my and my network’s unique knowledge and skillsets to design and create simply better and more insightful products and services.

Change Catalyst: What will be the biggest story around diversity and inclusion in 2017?
Ellie: The innovation that diverse entrepreneurs, community leaders, and tech workers really produce. Our impact. More visible leadership and connectivity of entrepreneurs and leaders of color. Better product and practice via supported and fully engaged talent. The idea that diversity compromises quality or anything else will begin to fade, even if internal policy and practice is slow to catch up. We’ve been seeing how diversity of thought really does come from diversity of experience and how those assets create more insightful products and services. More creative thinking and problem solving resulting in excellent product, period. In my experience, startups are quicker to buy in to that mentality as a part of the growth mindset — larger companies and institutions have a more complicated time.
Also, tech will take a bigger role in creating more equity in communities, becoming better neighbors and more articulate on the issues and ways in which companies positively or negatively affect communities. Every company is a social impact company. The question is whether their positive impact outweighs their negative impact.
The TechEquity Collaborative in Oakland has been able to build a membership model that incentivizes local companies to not only do better on D&I policy and practice, but to educate themselves on local issues and policy that affect their communities. I was an initial advisor on their Company Commitments Committee and it’s great to see TechEquity now taking a stand in moving forward the idea of sanctuary companies, as well as a critical examination of the role the tech community could play in housing policy here in the Bay Area, where we are experiencing a legitimate housing crisis. This is a more radical position than tech as a sector has thought about before. But the time has come. And yes, companies — not just communities — will be better off for it.
Change Catalyst: What one key solution would make a huge difference in creating a more inclusive tech ecosystem?
Ellie: Actual accountability. Hold your company accountable! We all talk about leadership buy-in, and many companies have that, but without systems of accountability, it’s too easy to fall short. Hold your company accountable to your D&I commitment by adding different types of metrics. Starting to measure retention, professional development, job satisfaction, and overall growth of your employees, with an analysis of how that plays out for diverse staff, will reflect how well you trust them to move on their intuition and experiential knowledge, how well they feel they belong and are valued.
Transparency of demographic data is no longer enough. Candidates are looking for work environments where they believe they will succeed, build new skills, and actually enjoy their time there. And that only happens with companies that have demonstrated clear buy-in and practice of holding themselves accountable to metrics and appropriately evolving standards.
Accountability is obvious, but it still needs to be called out.
Beyond that, real, sustained investment in communities of color would produce returns we have not yet seen. The talent and possibilities in our communities are immeasurable. We’ve barely begun to scratch the surface.
Change Catalyst: What is the best example of leadership in inclusion you’ve seen recently?
Ellie: Joshua Encarnacion and his colleagues at Outco are so inspiring to me right now with their launch and growth of OutColor. Joshua really leads with love and the type of mindset that helps individuals cultivate their strengths fearlessly, which is so key to being successful in tech.
Mai-Ling Garcia with the City of Oakland is taking a really inclusive approach to UX in designing digital services for the public that is integral to building resilient cities. She also works with OpenOakland, a Code for America brigade I was a part of for a long time, whose UX / Civic User Testing group is expert and, in my opinion, underutilized.
Change Catalyst: Describe the impact you’re having in your role.
Ellie: I get to bring the full intersectionality of all of my identities into my job as a strategist and problem solver. It really helps me identify vulnerabilities for bias sooner, advise clients on connecting with their diverse staff more deeply and meaningfully, and make more agile, specific, and practical recommendations with clear action plans.
In everything I do, I bring the perspective of being a mixed-race, bi/queer daughter of an Indonesian immigrant who drove a cab when he got here; and a brilliant, working class mom who barely finished high school. I bring the memories of growing up pretending to be middle class, having been the new kid in school 15 times and moving into new homes 25 times; the perspective of growing up without certain advantages and privileges in environments ranging from dense, urban neighborhoods to small, rural towns and everything in between.
I know what being on food stamps feels like; I know what three siblings sleeping in the same room (two of us on the floor) feels like; I know what living under the threat of violence feels like; and I know what being an Honors and Advanced Placement student who had no plan for college feels like. I also bring my advanced degrees and credentials; experience of working with the philanthropists, public officials, academics, entrepreneurs and executives I have; the ability to navigate environments of every extreme. Code switching and shape shifting is in my DNA.
Because of those perspectives and experiences, I understand the creativity, resourcefulness, agility, grit, determination, and resilience that they build in a person — and in communities. I know how that looks and feels on a grassroots level, and how communities come together and take care of each other when government and philanthropy don’t. So the knowledge of those intrinsic assets, including the expertise of our own experience, is a highly valuable thing. And all of that value, those assets, are what you gain when you recruit diverse candidates to join your team and help build your company, scale your product, and build your movements and markets.
My perspective and experience helps my company connect with clients more intimately, built trust sooner, and expose insights and opportunities other partners in this work miss. I help them cut through the fog and get more done.
Change Catalyst: Just for fun, what unique or unusual talent/skill do you have?
Ellie: Building diverse networks of friends and connecting folks to each other. Maybe some karaoke if you catch me on the right night. And making a dollar out of fifteen cents.
