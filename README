The Naive Bayes algorithm trains and categorizes data into the following categories: team performance, hiring, diversity, fundraising, UI/UX and other. 
The train data currently consists of 17 articles and after testing on a total of 120 articles the algorithm has a 95% success rate.

load_files_edits is an edit to scikit's load_files method and it catches decoding errors and attempts 2 basic forms of encoding to take in data. It also allowed for some files (DS_store in this case) to be ignored.
