Introducing Mobile Feedback and Check-ins Application
GroSum introduces mobile feedback application, in a bid to increase engagement and conversation between people in an organization.
When we look at the global stats, 
mobile email opens have grown by 180% in the last three years.
 Use of mobile phones in modern workplaces in inevitable because of productivity increase.
GroSum Mobile Feedback Application will have two major features:
Check-ins
Check-ins allows managers and employees to have a continuous conversation between them. For different performance objectives employees can engage with managers & can discuss achievements, challenges, plans, setbacks in real time. Despite people having frequent goal posts(quarterly/half-yearly) for discussions, ongoing engagement helps managers to coach employees and increase the chances of objective achievement.
2. Instant Feedback
With an aim to make feedback on-going and productive between employees, Instant Feedback allows anyone to give or get feedback on the go.
Instant Feedback allows people to give feedback to anyone in the organization, at any point in time. The feedback can be:
Kept anonymous
Shared exclusively with managers
Tag Performance Parameters
While people can get feedback about themselves or about anyone else in the organization.
