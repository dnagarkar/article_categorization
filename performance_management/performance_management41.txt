Another Year, Another Performance Review
As 2017 approaches, my colleagues and I are completing our year-end performance reviews. In preparation to receive my own performance review, I’ve given a lot of thought to what I would like to accomplish in 2017 and how I would like to go about my work.
I started my job back in July of this year after relocating to Denver in April. It was the one job that I really wanted and it aligns perfectly with my own values.
I was nervous for most of the day as I awaited my review discussion. I just wasn’t sure about how things would go. Not that I have anything to justify my nervousness. It’s just one of those things.
I still struggle with confidence and I tend to let the lizard brain have its way far too much. I often worry more than I should, and create stories in my head that aren’t true. It’s a constant struggle of mine that I am working to overcome.
At the end of the day, the review went well. We had a great discussion and put together some good plans for next year. To be honest, I accomplished a lot this year in a short amount of time. Thinking back on where I was a year ago, I would have never imagined I would be where I am today — doing work that I am passionate about that adds value to others.
